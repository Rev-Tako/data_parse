Please wait a moment....,I've got more than 1 lesson on 'Optics'. Here they are:,Lesson 1:,The proposed lesson is applicable in case of optical instruments based on holographic grating spectrometers where straylight is a key requirement.The proposed lesson is to incorporate the main parameters of the holographic setup during the definition of the optical design in order to have gratings that can be manufactured with holographic setup that is as simple as possible (virtually 2 point sources without collimating optics).,Lesson 2:,Testing conditions and aspects to take care of, do's and dont's, outliers and materials to avoid, radiation hard designs vs standard product. The RADGLASS project and approach in establishing a database of optical materials spectral transmittance properties versus radiation dose has been extremely valuable. This database is publically available on request. Access is frequently requested by European space industry, research institutes and internationally. The database should be actively maintained and kept up to date with new results.,Lesson 3:,There must be a really good reason not to build a cryogenic instrument from metal (i.e. Aluminium). Working with ceramic materials, such as SiC, is much more costly and difficult. Especially when the material is relatively novel, set-backs and additional process development activities must be anticipated.,Would you like to know background on this lesson?$$yes: Here is the only background information I found for this lesson:,Straylight is a key requirement for optical missions and for imaging spectrometers one of the main contribution is coming from the grating.In the frame of Flex we procured several holographic gratings from different suppliers trying to minimise grating straylight.One of the main conclusions that we reached is that for holographic gratings the straylight of the holographic setup (in particular ghosts) is crucial to have good quality gratings. This is due to the fact that interference between ghost beams generate several spurious grating structures. In particular if the holographic source is very simple (e.g. a point source withouth any collimating optics) we observed very low straylight (around 1 nm rms equivalent mirror roughness). The drawback is that the grating lines are not straight and parallel and this generate huge and unacceptable optical aberrationsThese aberrations can be compensated by the other optical elements of the spectrometer if the geometry of the holographic setup (in particular the mutual position of the two source points) is included as optimization parameter during the optical design of the spectrometer.

This can be anything, please try to enter a full paragraph. Single words or short answers will not work currently.$$TP For the modelling of a 2 body problem, where one object orbits around another, we can develop analytical methods of predicting the motion of the orbiting body. These are developed from Kepler's 3 laws: 1. the orbiting body will follow an elliptical path around the central body. 2. The orbiting body will sweep the same area of its orbit in the same period of time, no matter where in the orbit. 3. the period of an orbit is proportional to its semi-major axis. From these laws analytical equations for predicting the time of flight between different points in an orbit can be developed allowing orbital motion to be predicted: Do you have any context you would like to add to this lesson?$$TP These laws are useful for understanding orbital motion, but are not fully accurate as they rely on some assumptions that are not always true in practice: that there are only 2 bodies, that 1 body is significantly more massive than the other, that the bodies can be treated as point masses, and that there are no other forces than gravity acting on the bodies.: What background information would you like to share?$$TP no: What background information would you like to share?$$FP save lesson: Do you have any context you would like to add to this lesson?$$FP end lesson: Do you have any context you would like to add to this lesson?$$can you teach me about orbital mechanics: That is not within the scope of this project, please try something else$$FN hello: Your input is unexpected at this stage of conversation.

However, after every response from the bot, please type ‘TP’, ‘FP’, or ‘FN’, meaning True Positive, False Positive, or False Negative. This allows us to analyse the chatbot performance, compared to our expectations and also user expectations.,Lesson 2:,Orbital Design is the process of optimising the orbital parameters of a constellation of satellites to make it fit for purpose. It involves weighing the Spatial and Temporal resolutions of the target area against the cost of the constellation. In this process one seeks to reduce the cost, preferably via reducing the number of required satellites, without sacrificing the other objectives.,Lesson 3:,A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints; may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations; and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Typical examples of designs include architectural and engineering drawings, circuit diagrams, sewing patterns and less tangible artefacts such as business process models.,Would you like to know background on this lesson? yes/no$$yes: No Background found for this lesson.,Is there anything else I can help with?$$what is a Keplerian orbit: That is not within the scope of this project, please try something else$$tell me about orbits: What is the topic?$$orbital mechanics: That is not within the scope of this project, please try something else,What is the topic?$$keplerian dynamics: $$hello: Hi, I'm SCARLET, the Space Conversational Agent for Retrieving Lessons Learned and Expert Training.,My functions are retrieving existing lessons and capturing new lessons.,Try saying 'I want to learn' or 'I want to add a lesson' to get started.,If I ever get stuck please use /restart to restart the conversation.,How can I help?$$I want to learn about keplerian dynamics: What is the topic?$$keplerian dynamics: $$hello: Hi, I'm SCARLET, the Space Conversational Agent for Retrieving Lessons Learned and Expert Training.,My functions are retrieving existing lessons and capturing new lessons.,Try saying 'I want to learn' or 'I want to add a lesson' to get started.,If I ever get stuck please use /restart to restart the conversation.,How can I help?$$I want to learn about propulsion: What is the topic?$",
