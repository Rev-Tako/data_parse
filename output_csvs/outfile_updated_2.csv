Please wait a moment....,I've got more than 1 lesson on 'Optics'. Here they are:,Lesson 1:,The proposed lesson is applicable in case of optical instruments based on holographic grating spectrometers where straylight is a key requirement.The proposed lesson is to incorporate the main parameters of the holographic setup during the definition of the optical design in order to have gratings that can be manufactured with holographic setup that is as simple as possible (virtually 2 point sources without collimating optics).,Lesson 2:,Testing conditions and aspects to take care of, do's and dont's, outliers and materials to avoid, radiation hard designs vs standard product. The RADGLASS project and approach in establishing a database of optical materials spectral transmittance properties versus radiation dose has been extremely valuable. This database is publically available on request. Access is frequently requested by European space industry, research institutes and internationally. The database should be actively maintained and kept up to date with new results.,Lesson 3:,There must be a really good reason not to build a cryogenic instrument from metal (i.e. Aluminium). Working with ceramic materials, such as SiC, is much more costly and difficult. Especially when the material is relatively novel, set-backs and additional process development activities must be anticipated.,Would you like to know background on this lesson?$$yes: Here is the only background information I found for this lesson:,Straylight is a key requirement for optical missions and for imaging spectrometers one of the main contribution is coming from the grating.In the frame of Flex we procured several holographic gratings from different suppliers trying to minimise grating straylight.One of the main conclusions that we reached is that for holographic gratings the straylight of the holographic setup (in particular ghosts) is crucial to have good quality gratings. This is due to the fact that interference between ghost beams generate several spurious grating structures. In particular if the holographic source is very simple (e.g. a point source withouth any collimating optics) we observed very low straylight (around 1 nm rms equivalent mirror roughness). The drawback is that the grating lines are not straight and parallel and this generate huge and unacceptable optical aberrationsThese aberrations can be compensated by the other optical elements of the spectrometer if the geometry of the holographic setup (in particular the mutual position of the two source points) is included as optimization parameter during the optical design of the spectrometer. This was not the case for Flex.$$who wrote this lesson?: Here are the Author Names for the lesson:,Matteo Taccola,Is there anything else I can help with?$$what is optics?: That is not within the scope of this project, please try something else$$who was Buzz Aldrin?: Is there anything else I can help with?$$/restart: I'm sorry you've run into a problem.
