Please wait a moment :),I've got more than 1 lesson on 'Optics'. Here they are:,Lesson 1:,The proposed lesson is applicable in case of optical instruments based on holographic grating spectrometers where straylight is a key requirement.The proposed lesson is to incorporate the main parameters of the holographic setup during the definition of the optical design in order to have gratings that can be manufactured with holographic setup that is as simple as possible (virtually 2 point sources without collimating optics).,Lesson 2:,Testing conditions and aspects to take care of, do's and dont's, outliers and materials to avoid, radiation hard designs vs standard product. The RADGLASS project and approach in establishing a database of optical materials spectral transmittance properties versus radiation dose has been extremely valuable. This database is publically available on request. Access is frequently requested by European space industry, research institutes and internationally. The database should be actively maintained and kept up to date with new results.,Lesson 3:,There must be a really good reason not to build a cryogenic instrument from metal (i.e. Aluminium). Working with ceramic materials, such as SiC, is much more costly and difficult.
