Please wait a moment :),I don't have anything in my DB for this topic. Here's what I found in DBPedia instead:,Buzz Aldrin (/ˈɔːldrɪn/; born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American former astronaut, engineer and fighter pilot. He made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission. As the Lunar Module Eagle pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two people to land on the Moon. Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force, and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft. After earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis, Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, earned him the nickname "Dr. Rendezvous" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion. Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the Space Race by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy "of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" before the end of the decade. After leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies Return to Earth (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009) recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Aldrin continues to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars, and developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in terms of time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.,Is there anything else I can help with?, ",FEEDBACK: TP," who is buzz aldrin?: Is there anything else I can help with?, who is Buzz Aldrin?: Is there anything else I can help with?, Who was Buzz Aldrin?: Is there anything else I can help with?, what do you know about Buzz Aldrin?: I'm processing your request.

A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion. Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the Space Race by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy "of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" before the end of the decade. After leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies Return to Earth (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009) recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Aldrin continues to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars, and developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in terms of time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.,Is there anything else I can help with?, Is that all the information you have on him?: I am sorry but this is outside what I learnt to do. Can you try with something different?, Do you know anything about propulsion : I'm processing your request. Please wait a moment :),Here is the only lesson I have on 'Propulsion':,Important to assess with appropiate time and to consolidate the fuelling procedure prior departing to Kourou with the prime AIT and the subco Fuelling team.Lesson Keywords: Launch, Launch Campaign, AIT, Fuelling, Phase E1,Is there anything else I can help with?, Thank you that was helpful : How can I help?, ",

Please wait a moment :),I've got more than 1 lesson on 'Telescopes'. Here they are:,Lesson 1:,Testing conditions and aspects to take care of, do's and dont's, outliers and materials to avoid, radiation hard designs vs standard product. The RADGLASS project and approach in establishing a database of optical materials spectral transmittance properties versus radiation dose has been extremely valuable. This database is publically available on request. Access is frequently requested by European space industry, research institutes and internationally. The database should be actively maintained and kept up to date with new results.,Lesson 2:,Establish early (well before data analysis starts) the complete chain leading from optical modelling/measurement to the use of this information in scientific analysis, and optimize it using simulations. Put in place the ability to experiment rapidly and iteratively with optical modelling during the analysis phases. The ability to extract optical information from the sky data should be evaluated already at a very early stage.,Lesson 3:,From an Agency perspective it would have helped to involve also that team and gather their contribution within this community directly which would have saved time. In order to support that event/community I propose to organise a follow on LL event with the relevant TEC-Q personnel to complement the LL on that topic.,Lesson 4:,It's important to set-up a constructive dialogue with the contractors where they feel comfortable challenging certain requirements that are extremely difficult for them to achieve.,Lesson 5:,There must be a really good reason not to build a cryogenic instrument from metal (i.e. Aluminium). Working with ceramic materials, such as SiC, is much more costly and difficult. Especially when the material is relatively novel, set-backs and additional process development activities must be anticipated.,Lesson 6:,Maintain a very solid level of technical expertise within the ESA project team.,Lesson 7:,Make sure a fully fledged instrument EQM program is being implemented. It may cost more on paper at the beginning and will be difficult to get budgetted but it will return the investment made and make the manufacturing and testing of the FM a much smoother.,Is there anything else I can help with?, This is interesting, it answered but the responses are a bit odd: Is there anything else I can help with?, so FN: How can I help?, ",FEEDBACK: FN,"
